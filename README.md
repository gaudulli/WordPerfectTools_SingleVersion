# WordPerfectTools_SingleVersion

Template to interact with WordPerfect using WinForms, including simple examples of how to automate WP from .NET

This program is an educational tool for those wishing to automate WordPerfect by using a form that captures an instance of WP. The program has several sample GUI tools that provide different ways of accessing and modifying a WordPerfect document. The sample GUI functions can also be stripped, leaving a functioning empty template for you to create your own custom application to automate WordPerfect.

Don't bother trying to compile and run the code unless you have a version of WordPerfect (probably X3 or newer) installed on your machine.

You can always download a free trial version of WPX7 from Corel to try to the WordPerfect Tools program
